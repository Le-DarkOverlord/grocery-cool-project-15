How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work 
out as predicted?
moving from smart assistant to like 
lots of uncompleted feature
not integrated as much into the store/app
faster development time, we pickup the momentum

doing, or stop doing next time?
Difficult to coordinate with everybody
Difficult to implement all user stories
Finding time to meeting up
Difficult to rely on everybody  

Starting early
Planning
Code review
Test driven development

keep adjust to the situation
Updating the milestone

leaving everything to last minute

Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?
We came with a really good idea
Mobile development is really whole different development routine
Huge build and config files.
Compared to other classes is different way of doing things.
SOLID principle
technical debts
