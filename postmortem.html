            Firstly, I learned about agile practices and software
            architecture/design Furthermore, working with other people's code
            and also to actually use git for a <i>big</i> project. I also need
            taught myself to use cloud services to implement some of our
            features. Lastly, I think the most important takeaway for me is to
            always do test-driven development.

            Throughout this project, I learned a lot about android development
            concepts. For instance, how to manage the android dependencies,
            modifying the build and configuration files, and also working with
            XML files to make user interfaces in android studio. In addition to
            that, I also learned to work with databases and to integrate it with
            the logic/business layer, and using version control for a large
            scale project.

            From this project, I learned how to create an android application
            from start to finish. Especially, how to structure the system and
            making different parts of the system, like database and logic layer,
            to work together. As well as knowing to use XML as layout for the
            application and how that works with the Java code. I also learned
            how to develop a project as a team and how to manage different
            responsibilities and make sure our documentation files, issues, and
            milestones are updated.

            Throughout this project, I have learnt about the fundamental concept
            of working in a group. Moreover, I learnt many development skills
            regarding creating an app. For instance, having learnt how to work
            with android studio which would greatly contribute to my work in the
            future.

        <p class="py-2 text-justify px-lg-5">
          Since for most of us this is the first time developing an application
          as a team, there are definitely some issues that arose during the
          process. For instance, we see that communication is a major issue for
          the last two iteration. But, as we move on to iteration 3, we become
          more active on Slack and keeping each other on the same page.
          <br /><br />

          Other issue is that, for iteration 1 and 2, we usually wait until the
          last two weeks of the iteration and cram a lot of works for one week.
          We realize that this is <b>not</b> ideal. Therefore, we start our
          development very early for iteration 3 and we manage to accomplish a
          lot of milestones. <br /><br />

          We also identified improvements for iteration 3. We think for this
          iteration we manage to divide the workload equally among us. Also, we
          properly documented our issues and merge request in a great detail.
          Lastly, we finally picked up our momentum and shorten our development
          time for some tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 1 -->
      <div class="container text-center px-lg-5 py-3">
        <div class="container px-md-5 px-sm-0 text-center pb-4">
          <div class="container">
            <h4>
              How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision
              or stories, or did it work out as predicted?
            </h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="py-2 text-justify px-lg-5">
          Our initial vision was shifted throughout the iteration. Originally we
          inteded to make a smart grocery assistant app with very complex
          features such as displaying a route inside the store for a specific
          item, having user accounts to create and share recipes, and a payment
          system. During our first iteration we realized that our ideas are very
          ambitious. Therefore, we changed some of our estimations and just
          focused on features that we can complete in our sprints. Of course,
          this lead to a lot of uncompleted features. So, it did not work out as
          predicted.
          <br /><br />
          We think this is also due to slow development time for our first
          iterations since we were not that comfortable with android studio and
          mobile development. At first glance, there were a lot of stuffs going
          on (gradle, XML, RecylerView, Activity, Fragments, etc.). As we
          progressed to the last iteration, we became more proficient with
          android studio we managed to accomplish more tasks in our last
          iteration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <div class="container text-center px-lg-5 py-3">
        <div class="container px-md-5 px-sm-0 text-center pb-4">
          <div class="container">
            <h4>
              What did you learn about team or large project development? What
              will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?
            </h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="py-2 text-justify px-lg-5">
          In short, it is really difficult and we actually need to learn to work
          as a team. We learn that it is difficult to communicate and coordinate
          with many people, and it takes time to getting used to. Furthermore,
          if we don't make the distribution of the tasks very clear, then there
          will be a lot of merge conflicts. Lastly, don't push testing until the
          very last minute.
          <br /><br />
          When we have a large project in the future, we want to start planning
          before every iteration, doing test-driven development, and code review
          for merge requests.
          <br /><br />
          We also will be keep making adjustment for our stories, tasks, and
          estimations; To keep each other on the same page; and, updating our
          milestone after every iterations.
          <br /><br />
          Lastly, one thing that we should stop doing next time is that leaving
          everything (especially testing) to the last minute.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <div class="container text-center px-lg-5 py-3">
        <div class="container px-md-5 px-sm-0 text-center pb-4">
          <div class="container">
            <h4>
              Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?
            </h4>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="py-2 text-justify px-lg-5">
          We think we came with really great ideas but it's unfortunate we don't
          have time to accomplish all of them.
          <br /><br />
          Mobile development is a very challenging and it's a different
          development routine. For instance, we need to tweak the build and
          configuration files a lot. Also, from web dev perspective, to make
          something work in mobile need a huge amount of code compared to web.
          <br /><br />
          SOLID principle is very important. We will have a lot of technical
          debts if we don't follow it. It is better to take a long and SOLID way
          rather than the fast but leave us with a lot of techinical debts.
          <br /><br />
          Retrospective is also very important as part of agile development.
          It's a time when we can learn from our mistakes and improve ourself
          for the next iteration.
